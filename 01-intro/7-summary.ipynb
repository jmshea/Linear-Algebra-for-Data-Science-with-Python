    "* Jupyter notebooks can use the mathematical markup features of LaTeX to provide beautifully formatted equations.\n",
    "* Python is widely used in the data science and machine learning communities.\n",
    "* Python has many well-developed libraries for data science and other applications.\n",
    "* Python uses 0-based indexing. This is the same as the C/C++ programming language but different than MATLAB.\n",
    "* Python operators try to do the right thing with the inputs they are given, but sometimes this can lead to unexpected results.\n",
    "* Python variables often point to objects like lists and arrays. Setting a new variable equal to an existing variable does not make a copy unless a variableâ€™s \\sphinxcode{copy()} method is used explicitly.\n",
    "* Indentation is used in Python to determine the scope of statements. This is very different than many other languages, such as C/C++, which use delimiters such as \\{\\} for this purpose.\n",

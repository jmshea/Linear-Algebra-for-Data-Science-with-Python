    "Although this book is generally designed for scientists and engineers, it should be accessible to anyone who knows:\n",

    "* Algebra and trigonometry\n",
    "* Some computer programming language (knowing Python is helpful, but not required)\n",
    "* Complex numbers (minimal knowledge, only in [Chapter 6: Transforming Data](../06-transforming-data/intro))\n",
    "\n",
    "This book was written by an engineer with degrees in both electrical and computer engineering. This book and its companion, *Foundations of Data Science with Python*, were written to provide the main textbooks for a 4-credit, semester-long course for engineers taught in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Florida.\n",
